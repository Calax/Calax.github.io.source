                    Database of guests is the most popular and most heavy loaded subsystem of restaurant administration portal. When I joined Plazius team in january, it was obvious that this subsystem is outdated (too slow, not enough data, etc.) and needed to be rewritten. I was given a task to build a new reporting system.<br/>
                    I updated (rewrote from scratch) SQL queries to operational database to make them faster and more reliable. After that I started implementation of reporting system. I built a storage (SQL Server, data are replicating from operational database) and developed backend code (ASP.NET Web API). Contract with frontend are operating via GraphQL.

                    I was engaged in receiving data from clients, its preparation (analysis, filtering, cleaning, etc.), loading in our database (MongoDB) synchronization with distribution system. We have a cluster of servers running our processing services to prepare hundreds of gigabytes of data. I became a team lead in May 2016. Since that time our team (3 developers and 1 tester) successfully implemented integration with systems of 5 big customers. Our team has a cluster of servers processing about 1 TB of data on a weekly basis.

                    One of latest great achievements I consider rewriting of export system using reactive programming so that our export became 4-times faster.
                    <br/>
                    Last my project as a CNET team member was development of standard integration feed. We introduced new rich-featured standard integration that allowed us to do integrations with client data in a single day.

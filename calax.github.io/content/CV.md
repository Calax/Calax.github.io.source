                    I was engaged in receiving data from clients, its preparation (analysis, filtering, cleaning, etc.), loading in our database (MongoDB) synchronization with distribution system. We have a cluster of servers running our processing services to prepare hundreds of gigabytes of data. I became a team lead in May 2016. Since that time our team (3 developers and 1 tester) successfully implemented integration with systems of 5 big customers. Our team has a cluster of servers processing about 1 TB of data on a weekly basis.
                    <br/>
                    One of latest great achievements I consider rewriting of export system using reactive programming so that our export became 4-times faster.
                    <br/>
                    Last my project as a CNET team member was development of standard integration feed. We introduced new rich-featured standard integration that allowed us to do integrations with client data in a single day.
